        <h3>Defining a Zoë;</h3>
        <h4>An over-zealous design student, photographer, and content creator. She's medically certified to be
            intolerant to all things norm, and bases her diet on going against the flow. ️<br><br>
            With a voice that can be heard from miles away, this unstoppable extrovert will strategize a brand concept,
            interactive marketing, and experiential design displays before you could finish the word “idea”. Trust me,
            she’s been tested.️ <br><br> Born on August 5th '98, creative skills were noticable to close relatives from
            an early age. Her 8 year dream of becoming a fashion designer was over by the age of 14, when she realised
            that her portfolio was too concise. After investing in a black plastic A3 book-folder, she began her
            compilation.
            <br><br> Roughly 6 years later, the soon-to-be graduate holds a vast portfolio ranging from editorial
            design,
            photography, illustration, social media content, installations, brand concepts, packaging designs,
            augmented reality animations, virtual reality videography, and more, proudly.</h4>
